👨‍💻 Kenneth – Lead Quant Developer 📧 Contact: <kennethlegare5@gmail.com>

📌 Overview
This repository contains a high-performance predictive trading model for equity derivatives, integrating deep learning, statistical analysis, and risk management principles. Built for hedge funds and high-frequency trading, the project utilizes TensorFlow, PyTorch, tf-quant-finance, Statsmodels, and GS Quant to enhance algorithmic trading strategies.

📈 Strategy Logic
Core Algorithm: Hybrid of momentum trading, mean reversion, and volatility-based derivatives analysis. ✔ LSTM/Transformer networks predict market movements ✔ Statistical arbitrage detects mispricing opportunities ✔ Sharpe Ratio optimization ensures risk-adjusted returns

⚡ Key Features
✔ Quantitative Trading Algorithms: Momentum, mean reversion, and volatility-based strategies ✔ Deep Learning Models: LSTM, Transformer, and RL (DQN/PPO) for predictive analytics ✔ Time Series & Statistical Analysis: GARCH modeling, Bayesian inference, and Monte Carlo simulations ✔ Risk Management Framework: Value at Risk (VaR), stop-loss controls, position sizing ✔ High-Fidelity Backtesting: Realistic trade execution latency and cost analysis ✔ Performance Optimization: Sharpe Ratio maximization with hyperparameter tuning ✔ Low-Latency Execution: Smart order routing & liquidity optimization for high-frequency trading

🛠 Tech Stack
✔ Python (3.9+) ✔ TensorFlow / PyTorch (for deep learning) ✔ tf-quant-finance (quantitative finance tools) ✔ Statsmodels (statistical modeling & time series forecasting) ✔ GS Quant (Goldman Sachs institutional analytics & market data) ✔ Zipline / Backtrader (for backtesting) ✔ CircleCI (CI/CD pipeline automation)
